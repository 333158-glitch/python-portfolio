# Test Score Prediction AI

## Problem
I wanted to see if a computer could predict a student’s test score based on how long they studied and how much they slept.

## Solution
I created a small dataset and trained a machine learning model that looks for patterns between study time, sleep, and test scores.

## Tools
Python  
pandas  
scikit-learn  

## Results
The AI was able to predict a test score for a student who studied 6 hours and slept 8 hours.

## Learning
I learned how machine learning models use data to make predictions and how to build and publish an AI project using Python.
